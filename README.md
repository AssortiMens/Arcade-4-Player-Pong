# Arcade-4-Player-Pong

This a first attempt to whatever software I am publishing.

It is supposed to be an Arcade version of a 4-player pong game, pong look alike game.

Download and install the latest version of Processing first at https://www.processing.org

Startup your Processing IDE and load the pde-file into the editor. Then hit the arrow- or run-button.

Or execute at the commandline:

sudo processing-java --sketch="path where your source or pde-file is stored" --run

skip the sudo command if you are executing from within windows.

Always try to maintain the following directory-structure:

FourPlayerPong/
FourPlayerPong/data

Put the pde-file in map FourPlayerPong and create your data directory there also. Next, put your mp3-files in the data-map.

Thank You!
